# Docker
# Don't ignore the Dockerfile or docker-compose.yml as they are part of the project structure
# but generated build contexts or images might be ignored.
# For now, no specific Docker output to ignore, as images are built and pushed, not stored locally.

# Dependencies (if not managed by specific package managers)
# For example, if a `vendor/` directory were used.
# But for Python, .venv/ covers this. For Dart, .dart_tool/ covers it.
# Secrets and credentials
# These should ideally be outside the repo or handled by secrets management,
# but if they appear, they should be ignored.
